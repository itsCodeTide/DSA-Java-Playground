# DSA-Java-Playground
 A complete collection of Data Structures and Algorithms in Java — from arrays to advanced patterns. Built while learning and exploring core concepts of problem-solving and efficient coding.
 
This repo contains my learning journey through **Data Structures & Algorithms** in Java. I'm currently exploring:

- 📌 Arrays, Strings, Searching & Sorting
- 📌 Recursion, Hashing, Stack, Queue, and more
- 📌 Pattern-based problems (Sliding Window, Two Pointer, etc.)
- 📌 Frequently asked interview questions

---

## 🔧 How to Run
Clone the repo and run any `.java` file in your IDE or using `javac` and `java` commands.

## 💡 Why this repo?
To learn, build, and document core DSA concepts — and share the journey!

# 🚀 DSA Playground — Powered by Java ☕️

Hi, I'm **Labh Jethe** 👋  
This is where I learn, build, and break down the essentials of **Data Structures and Algorithms** one line of code at a time.

## 🧩 What’s Inside?

📦 This repository is packed with my hands-on practice in:
- 🔁 Arrays — from traversals to advanced algorithms  
- 🔎 Searching & Sorting — Binary Search, Bubble Sort, and beyond  
- 🧠 Problem-solving — Kadane’s, Moore’s Voting Algorithm, N/K frequency, and more  
- 📚 Classic DSA patterns — all implemented manually for deeper understanding

Each file is clean, well-commented, and focused on **concept clarity** over shortcuts.

## 🛠️ How I Use This Repo

- 👨‍💻 Reinforce DSA concepts
- 🔍 Reference patterns during interviews or revisions
- 🧪 Experiment with variations, edge cases & logic rewrites
- ✍️ Track learning progress and reflect on growth

---

## 🧠 Why Manual Implementations?

Because magic happens when you type it out, debug it, and make it work.  
I avoid built-in shortcuts and write everything step by step — from scratch.
