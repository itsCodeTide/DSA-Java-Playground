## 📌 What is Sorting?

Sorting means **rearranging items in a collection** (like an array or list) into a specific order—usually ascending or descending. For example, transforming `[10, 5, 8, 2]` into `[2, 5, 8, 10]`. It’s a fundamental operation because ordered data speeds up searching, merging, and data processing .

## 🧠 Important Concepts in Sorting

1. **Comparison-based vs. non-comparison-based**

   * *Comparison-based* (e.g., Bubble, Merge, Quick): use element comparisons
   * *Non-comparison-based* (e.g., Counting, Radix): rely on other strategies ([Medium][1])
2. **Stable vs. Unstable**

   * *Stable*: equal items keep original order (Insertion, Merge)
   * *Unstable*: equal items may move around (Selection, Quick) ([Stack Overflow][2])
3. **In-place vs. Out-of-place**

   * *In‑place* uses no extra storage (e.g., Bubble, Insertion)
   * *Out‑of‑place* uses extra memory (e.g., Merge) ([Medium][1], [YouTube][3], [Medium][4])
4. **Time & Space Complexity**

   * Use Big‑O notation (best/avg/worst) to rate efficiency ([Programiz][5])

## 🔁 Basic (Quadratic Time) Sorting Algorithms

These are simple and best applied to small datasets or teaching concepts.

### Bubble Sort

* Repeatedly *swap adjacent out-of-order elements*.
* *Best-case*: O(n) if already sorted, *worst/avg*: O(n²) ([Wikipedia][6], [Stack Abuse][7]).
* It's stable and in-place, but slow – mainly educational ([Wikipedia][8]).

### Selection Sort

* Repeatedly *select the smallest* from the unsorted part and swap it into place.
* Always O(n²) time, regardless of input ([Wikipedia][6]).
* In-place but *unstable*.

### Insertion Sort

* Builds a sorted region by *inserting one item at a time* into its correct position.
* *Best-case*: O(n) for nearly sorted input; *worst/avg*: O(n²) ([GeeksforGeeks][9], [Wikipedia][10]).
* Stable, in-place, and great for small or partially sorted data .

## ⚡ Advanced “Divide & Conquer” (O(n log n)) Algorithms

Efficient for large data—though often more complex to implement.

### Merge Sort

* Splits data in half, *recursively sorts* each half, then *merges* them back.
* Always O(n log n) time; uses extra memory for merging ([VisuAlgo][11], [Medium][4]).
* Stable and excellent for predictable performance.

### Quick Sort

* Picks a *pivot*, partitions elements into “less than” / “greater than”, and recursively sorts partitions.
* *Average time*: O(n log n), *worst-case*: O(n²) on bad pivot choices ([Medium][1], [Wikipedia][12]).
* In-place and fast in practice, but unstable.
* Java uses a refined “dual-pivot” Quick Sort since version 7, combined with Insertion Sort for small partitions ([arXiv][13]).

## 🔹 Non-Comparison Sorting (Linear Time)

These avoid comparisons and can be faster under certain conditions.

### Counting Sort

* Suitable for integers in a limited range (`0…k`).
* Time complexity: O(n + k), where k is range size ([GeeksforGeeks][14]).
* Stable and fast, but needs extra space of size k.

Other examples include Radix Sort, Bucket Sort, etc. ([Programiz][5]).

## 🧭 Choosing the Right Sort

* **Tiny arrays (<20)** → Bubble, Insertion, or Selection (Insertion often best)
* **Large, general data** → Merge Sort for stability, or Quick Sort for speed
* **Integers with small range** → Counting Sort for linear time
* **Partially sorted data** → Insertion Sort shines ([Wikipedia][10], [Reddit][15], [YouTube][3], [Wikipedia][16])

## 🔄 Summary

Sorting is arranging data in a particular order. There are various algorithms with trade-offs in:

* **Time efficiency** (O(n²) vs O(n log n) vs O(n + k))
* **Memory use** (in-place vs extra space)
* **Stability** (whether equal values stay in order)

In our next step, I can show you Java code for these algorithms—just say the word!
